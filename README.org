* A getter for random wallpapers from the [[http://alpha.wallhaven.cc][Wallhaven Wallpapers]] website.

This program, as of now, literally only provides the simplest possible
implementation of this idea. It has no provision to log in, which
means that the wallpapers will not include any NSFW content. It creates
a directory hierarchy under your $HOME: Desktop_pics/YYMMDD/ where
YYMMDD literally represents the canonical date on which the program is
run. It stores the images inside of this directory.

** TODO -- implement login.
