* A getter for random wallpapers from the [[http://alpha.wallhaven.cc][Wallhaven Wallpapers]] website.

This program, as of now, literally only provides the simplest possible
implementation of this idea. It has no provision to log in, which
means that the wallpapers will not include any NSFW content, and there
is no provision for downloading images with specific tags. It creates
a directory hierarchy under your $HOME: Desktop_pics/YYMMDD/ where
YYMMDD literally represents the canonical date on which the program is
run, and stores the images inside of it.

At the moment, this code uses a function from the cl-mechanize system,
which is not listed in the exports for that sytem. I have filed a pull
request with the project author. In the meantime, reach into
cl-mechanize and pull out the relevant function, even though this is rude.

** TODO -- implement login.
** TODO -- implement tag searching
